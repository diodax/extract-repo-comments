# extract-repo-comments

> Extract comments from source code repositories of Java projects

## Overview

## Example

Given that the target project is located at `jhotdraw-git/JHotDraw/`, and we're checking files with the `.java` extension:

```bash
$ node index.js -l=jhotdraw-git/JHotDraw/ -e=.java > jhotdraw-results.log
```

The json output is shown in the command line by default. To export it to a file, we use `> output-filename.log`.
